Terminal oxidases provide the final step in aerobic respiration by reducing oxygen. The mycobacteria possess two terminal oxidases: a cytochrome c aa3 type and a quinol bd type. We previously isolated a bd-type oxidase knockout mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis that allowed for functional analysis of the aa3 type without the contribution of bd-type activity. Growth of M. smegmatis LR222 and JAM1 (LR222bd::kan) was monitored and the cytochrome content at different time points examined. No difference in aerobic growth was observed between M. smegmatis LR222 and JAM1. Membranes were obtained from these cultures and the oxidase concentrations were calculated from their spectrum.
